# AWS CodeArtifact Semantic Release Example

## Summary

This pattern shows how to integrate [semantic-release][semantic-release] into
your project to automate the entire package release workflow of determining the
next version number, generating release notes, and publishing the package to
[AWS CodeArtifact][codeartifact].

In this example, we will be using GitHub with semantic-release to automate the
release workflow of an npm package.

## Prerequisites and Limitations 

### Prerequisites fdsfdsafds

- An active [AWS account][create-aws-account].
- An [AWS CodeArtifact][codeartifact] repository.
- A [GitHub][github] repository.
- [Node.js][nodejs] v14.x or later on developer machines.

### Limitations

- The [semantic-release-coderatifact][semantic-release-codeartifact] plugin
currently only supports npm at the time of writing.

## Architecture

![Architecture Image][architecture-img]

The diagram shows the following workflow:

1. Developers commit changes to the GitHub repository following a standardized
commit message format (enforced by [commitizen][commitizen]).

1. The GitHub Action [release workflow][release-workflow] assumes the IAM role
for publishing to CodeArtifact.

1. The npm package is published to the CodeArtifact repository.

## Tools

- [AWS CodeArtifact][codeartifact] - Fully managed artifact repository service.
- [GitHub Actions][github-actions] - Runs release workflow.
- [semantic-release][semantic-release] - Used to automate the package release workflow.
- [semantic-release-codeartifact][semantic-release-codeartifact] - Plugin for AWS CodeArtifact.
- [commitizen][commitizen] - Command line utility to help standardize commit messages.
- [husky][husky] - Adds git hooks we use for automatically running commitizen on commit.
